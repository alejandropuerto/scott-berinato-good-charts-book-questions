<ol>
    <li><strong>What are the two questions we need to ask ourselves in order to define the type of visualization we want to use?</strong></li>
        - Is the information conceptual or data-driven?<br>
        - Am I declaring something or exploring something?
    <li><strong>What generates a good declarative visualization?</strong></li>
        Discussion.
    <li><strong>What are the four types of visualization according to the questions and the book?</strong></li>

        - Visual discovery
    <li><strong>What are the two categories of data discovery visualization type?</strong></li>
        - Visual confirmation<br>

</ol>

### Chapter 7: Persuation or Manipulation?: The blurred edge of truth

<ol>
    <li><strong>What are the three most common techniques that could make charts be deceptive ?</strong></li>
    - Truncating the y-axis.<br>
    - Double the y-axis.<br>
    - Using a map to represent some kind of information.
    <li><strong>Why truncating the y-axis make charts deceptive?</strong></li>
    It exaggerating or misrepresent change in some information.
    <li><strong>Why truncating the y-axis make charts effective?</strong></li>
    It emphasizes change in the information.
    <li><strong>Why doubling the y-axis make charts depective?</strong></li>
    Plotting two different data and having two different scales in the same plot space.
    <li><strong>Why doubling the y-axis make charts effective?</strong></li>
    It relates the represented data. 
    <li><strong>Why using a map make charts deceptive?</strong></li>
    The size of a region might not reflect the data that wants to be represented. 
</ol>
